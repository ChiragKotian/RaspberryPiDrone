# Raspberry Pi Drone Steps and ROS
In this project we integrated Raspberry Pi and ROS with drone to explore various ways it can be controlled and various other aspects.

## Some good softwares to use with Ubuntu Server version:
1. **Vim (Text Editor which is like an IDE):**
   You can use ```$ vimtutor``` to start an inbuilt tutorial, which is pretty detailed and comprehensive. _(See bottom of terminal to know the mode you are in)_.
   Here, we will try to give you some notes we made from the tutorial. 
  
3. **Tmux(Multiwindow terminal with facilitates easy switching and other functions)**
